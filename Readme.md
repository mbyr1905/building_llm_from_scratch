-> LLM vs NLPs
NLP is task specific, but a LLm can perform wide range of NLP tasks.
-> What is making LLM special.
Transformer architecture is the main import part of LLm which makes LLM work.

-> Pre training LLM vs Fine tuning of LLM

Creating LLm = pre training + fine tuning

-> Pre training: Training on a large and diverse dataset. 
-> Fine tuning: Refining
